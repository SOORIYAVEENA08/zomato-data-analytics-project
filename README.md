This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data to answer key questions about customer preferences and service trends. Using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights. The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook for an interactive and organized workflow. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visually explore the data interactively.

Key Questions Addressed:

1.Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?

2.Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?

3.What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

Tools and Techniques:

1.Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

2.NumPy & pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

3.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visually appealing and informative data visualizations.

4.Power BI: For interactive and professional dashboard creation, making the insights more accessible and visually impactful.

Project Outcomes:

* Insights into the delivery preferences of restaurants.
* Identification of popular restaurant types based on customer reviews and ratings.
* Analysis of pricing trends to understand the preferred budget for couples dining out.
* An interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time exploration of the Zomato data, providing an enhanced user experience.

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze real-world datasets, visualize key findings effectively, and generate actionable insights in the field of data analytics. The Power BI dashboard further highlights my proficiency in creating professional and interactive visualizations for data-driven decision-making.
