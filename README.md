This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data to answer key questions about customer preferences and service trends. Using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights. The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook for an interactive and organized workflow.

Key Questions Addressed:

1.Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?

2.Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?

3.What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?


Tools and Techniques:

1.Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

2.NumPy & pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

3.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visually appealing and informative data visualizations.


Project Outcomes:

Insights into the delivery preferences of restaurants.
Identification of popular restaurant types based on customer reviews and ratings.
Analysis of pricing trends to understand the preferred budget for couples dining out.
This project showcases my ability to analyze real-world datasets and generate actionable insights in the field of data analytics.
